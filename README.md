### üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

This project consists of two main components that work together:

1.  **Frontend (This Repository):** An interactive Streamlit dashboard that serves as the user interface for analytics and forecasting.
2.  **Backend (Separate Repository):** A Flask-based REST API that handles all machine learning computations, feature engineering, and model predictions.

‚û°Ô∏è **You can find the backend API repository here: [github.com/arslan15114/aurorix-api](https://github.com/arslan15114/aurorix-api)**

Welcome to the **Aurorix.Retail Dashboard**‚Äîan intuitive, multi-page web application designed to transform retail management from guesswork into a data-driven science. Built with Streamlit, this platform provides managers and analysts with a powerful toolkit for making smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions.

The application communicates with our dedicated `aurorix-api` to fetch real-time forecasts and visualizes both predictive and historical data in a user-friendly and actionable way, turning complex data streams into clear business insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÆ Main Dashboard:** A central command center displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) like model accuracy and analysis speed. It features a detailed, interactive chart for sales dynamics for any selected product/store combination.
- **üìà Historical Analysis Module:** A strategic tool for a 30,000-foot view of the business, featuring:
    - **Top Sales Analysis:** An intuitive heatmap-style table that visualizes not only *what* the top-10 products are, but also *when* they sell best.
    - **Store Comparison:** A benchmarking tool to compare the performance of all retail locations and identify leaders and laggards.
- **ü§ñ AI Assistant:** An interactive simulation of an AI analyst that acts as a "virtual consultant." It automatically flags key events in the sales history and provides clear, human-readable explanations for anomalies with a single click.
- **üåç Multi-Language Support:** A fully localized interface with seamless, on-the-fly switching between Russian and Uzbek, demonstrating our readiness for regional scaling.

### üß† Machine Learning Methodology

The core of our product is a predictive model built using the **LightGBM** gradient boosting algorithm, chosen for its speed and accuracy. To achieve a high level of forecast precision, we developed a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline that turns raw data into intelligent signals for the model.

#### **Key Feature Groups:**
- **Lag Features:** Sales from the previous 1, 7, 14, and 28 days to capture short-term momentum and weekly seasonality.
- **Rolling Statistics:** Moving averages, standard deviations, and other metrics for sales over various time windows to understand recent trends.
- **Calendar Features:** Day of the week, week of the year, month, and flags for national holidays and important pre-holiday periods.
- **Price-Related Features:** Current price, discount percentage, and promotion flags to model the impact of pricing strategies on demand.

The model was trained on a rich historical dataset and underwent a rigorous hyperparameter tuning phase to ensure optimal performance on a validation set.
